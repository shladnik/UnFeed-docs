# Privacy Policy for UnFeed

**Effective Date:** June 7, 2025

## 1. What We Collect

* **Photos & Metadata**

  * UnFeed reads your photo library (images, creation dates, EXIF metadata) **only** with your explicit permission.
    * If you enable AI Captions, a thumbnail of each photo plus minimal metadata (timestamp, location — if available) is sent to our third-party caption service.

    * **Location**

      * If a photo has GPS data, we use it to reverse-geocode a human-readable place name (e.g. city, country).
        * Geocoding happens locally when possible; in rare cases we send coordinates to Apple’s reverse-geocoding servers.

        * **Usage Data**

          * No analytics or crash-reporting is collected. UnFeed does not phone home with your usage patterns.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

* **Offline Browsing & Slideshow**

  * All image display and navigation happens on-device.
  * **AI Captions**

    * If you turn on “AI Captions,” we upload a small, downscaled JPEG and metadata **only** to generate a short joke or caption.
    * **Sharing**

      * When you hit “Share,” the app prepares a new image with a watermark for iOS’s standard share sheet—you choose the target app.

## 3. Third-Party Services

* **Caption Generation**

  * We use OpenRouter.ai’s chat API to produce captions. See their [privacy policy](https://openrouter.ai/policy) for details on how they handle data.
  * **Apple APIs**

    * Photos and CoreLocation services are governed by Apple’s privacy practices.

## 4. Data Retention & Security

* No user data is stored on our servers—everything stays on your device except the few AI API calls you explicitly trigger.
* We do not retain your images or metadata on any backend.

## 5. Your Choices

* **Disable AI Captions** at any time in settings—no data will be sent thereafter.
* **Revoke Photo Access** in iOS Settings → UnFeed → Photos; this stops all access to your library.

## 6. Children

UnFeed is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect data from them.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as we add features. If we make material changes, we’ll bump the “Effective Date” here.
