# Privacy Policy for UnFeed

**Effective Date:** August 25, 2025

## 1. What We Collect

- **Photos & Metadata**  
  - UnFeed reads your photo library (images, creation dates, EXIF metadata) **only** with your explicit permission.  
  - If you enable AI content, a thumbnail of each photo plus minimal metadata (timestamp, location — if available) is sent to a third-party AI service.

- **Location**  
  - If a photo has GPS data, we use it to reverse-geocode a human-readable place name (e.g. city, country).  
  - Geocoding happens locally when possible. We send coordinates to Apple’s reverse-geocoding servers as needed.

- **Usage Data**  
  - No analytics or crash-reporting is collected. UnFeed does not phone home with your usage patterns.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

- **Offline Browsing & Slideshow**  
  All image display and navigation happens on-device.

- **AI Content**  
  If you turn on AI content, we upload a small, down-scaled JPEG and metadata **only** to generate a short image description. Note that these uploads go directly to the third-party AI service; UnFeed itself does **not** send, collect, or store this data on any UnFeed servers.

- **Sharing**  
  When you tap “Share,” UnFeed invokes iOS’s standard share sheet with a generated image. We don’t upload or store your photo on our servers—any further handling is managed by Apple and the app you choose.

## 3. Third-Party Services

- **Content Generation**  
  We use OpenRouter.ai’s chat API to produce content. See their [privacy policy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy) for details on how they handle data. We use models that do not collect data.

- **Apple APIs**  
  Photos and CoreLocation services are governed by Apple’s privacy practices.

## 4. Data Retention & Security

- No user data is sent to or stored on UnFeed’s servers—everything stays on your device except the AI API calls made when AI content is enabled, which go directly to the third-party content provider.
- We do not retain your images or metadata on any backend.

## 5. Your Choices

- **Disable AI Content** at any time in settings—no data will be sent thereafter.  
- **Revoke Photo Access** in _Settings → UnFeed → Photos_; this stops all access to your library.

## 6. Children

UnFeed is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect data from them.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as we add features. If we make material changes, we’ll bump the “Effective Date” here.
