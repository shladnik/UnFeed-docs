# Privacy Policy for UnFeed

**Effective Date:** June 7, 2025

## 1. What We Collect

- **Photos & Metadata**  
  - UnFeed reads your photo library (images, creation dates, EXIF metadata) **only** with your explicit permission.  
  - If you enable AI Captions, a thumbnail of each photo plus minimal metadata (timestamp, location — if available) is sent to our third-party caption service.

- **Location**  
  - If a photo has GPS data, we use it to reverse-geocode a human-readable place name (e.g. city, country).  
  - Geocoding happens locally when possible; in rare cases we send coordinates to Apple’s reverse-geocoding servers.

- **Usage Data**  
  - No analytics or crash-reporting is collected. UnFeed does not phone home with your usage patterns.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

- **Offline Browsing & Slideshow**  
  All image display and navigation happens on-device.

- **AI Captions**  
  If you turn on “AI Captions,” we upload a small, down-scaled JPEG and metadata **only** to generate a short joke or caption. Note that these uploads go directly to the third-party AI service; UnFeed itself does **not** send, collect, or store this data on any UnFeed servers.

- **Sharing**  
  When you hit “Share,” the app prepares a new image with a watermark for iOS’s standard share sheet—you choose the target app.

## 3. Third-Party Services

- **Caption Generation**  
  We use OpenRouter.ai’s chat API to produce captions. See their [privacy policy](https://openrouter.ai/policy) for details on how they handle data.

- **Apple APIs**  
  Photos and CoreLocation services are governed by Apple’s privacy practices.

## 4. Data Retention & Security

- No user data is sent to or stored on UnFeed’s servers—everything stays on your device except the AI API calls made when “AI Captions” is enabled, which go directly to the third-party caption provider.
- We do not retain your images or metadata on any backend.

## 5. Your Choices

- **Disable AI Captions** at any time in settings—no data will be sent thereafter.  
- **Revoke Photo Access** in _Settings → UnFeed → Photos_; this stops all access to your library.

## 6. Children

UnFeed is not directed at children under 13 and does not knowingly collect data from them.

## 7. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as we add features. If we make material changes, we’ll bump the “Effective Date” here.
